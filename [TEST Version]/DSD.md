[EasyEDA] 立创EDA

 [Offical Web](https://easyeda.com/)

I used EDA software when designing.Free, excellent compatibility, lightweight, and general functionality.

It is compatible with Windows, Linux, BSD and many other operating systems, and also has a web version, which is lighter than KiCad.

It is more suitable for the design of two-layer board.Has very mature design logic and function.Can be semi-professional design.

In addition, we have one-stop component procurement and PCB proofing services. In China, we can receive finished products within 24 hours with only a few bucks.

[AD] Altium Designer

EasyEDA files seem to be able to be converted to AD format without loss.

There are currently no problems detected in the transformation.

AD allows for more advanced operations.

[Eagle] Autodesk Eagle & Autodesk Fusion360

Because I used Autodesk modeling software for a while.

Among them, Fusion360 is very malleable to Eagle PCB, which can be directly used to design 3D printing or CNC shell for PCB.

There is currently no lossless conversion of files to Eagle format, and the logic of using Eagle is difficult to master.

[KiCAD] KiCAD

Similar to EasyEDA's positioning.

Since many open source projects use this software, I am also trying to convert my files to this format.

But so far it hasn't been successful.
